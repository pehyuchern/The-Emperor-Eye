This project use a camera to has a real-time observation. Once a person is passing through the camera, his or her face will be detected and converted into embeddings values. These embeddings values will be recorded down together with the time and venue(which is where the camera located). The authorised person can trace a person by inserting that person's face. The system will convert that face into embeddings values and then do a clustering based on the data that has recorded. After clustering done, the system will show all the previous time and venue of that person that has appeared before.
